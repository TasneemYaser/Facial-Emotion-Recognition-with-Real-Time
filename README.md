# Facial-Emotion-Recognition-with-Real-Time
This project implements a real-time facial emotion recognition system. It involves setting up an environment using Kaggle datasets to train a CNN model, which is later used to detect emotions in real time through webcam video feed. The project combines dataset preparation, model training, and live video input processing using Keras and OpenCV.
